# Tools and Integrations

Ocean for Apache Spark (Ocean Spark) is a managed cloud-native Spark service built on top of [Ocean’s](ocean/) serverless engine, dedicated to making Apache Spark developer-friendly and cost effective. Ocean Spark is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster inside your cloud account and gives you a serverless experience when working with Apache Spark.

Ocean Spark comes built-in with integrations with popular data tools such as [Jupyter Notebooks](ocean-spark/tools-integrations/connect-jupyter-notebooks) and scheduling solutions like Airflow. The procedures in this section detail how to configure and use them with an Ocean Spark cluster.
