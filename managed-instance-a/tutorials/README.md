Managed Instances utilize spot instances while providing persistence for the root volume, data volumes, and network interface, in addition to other launch specifications during instance replacements.

Spot Managed Instances are designed to support any fault-tolerant applications, such as databases and stream-processing servers. If you have a stateful application or an application that is designed to withstand node failure, you can maintain your configurations with 0 data loss while taking advantage of the cost savings provided by spot instances.
