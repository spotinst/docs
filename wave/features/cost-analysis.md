# Cost Analysis

Wave provides full visibility into the cost of your wave cluster, including a cost analysis over time per Spark application, a detailed cost drill down on each application, and your total cost for the Wave cluster.

To get to the Wave Cluster Cost Analysis tab, do the following:
1. In the Spot console, go to Wave in the menu tree and click Clusters.
2. In the list of Clusters, click on a Cluster Name and click the Cost Analysis tab.

The Cost Analysis tab opens and shows the cluster name at the top.

## Spark App Cost over Time

The first part of the cost analysis is a bar chart showing your Spark application costs over time. Above the chart, you can set the time range for displaying data in the chart.

Each bar shows the total cost of the Wave cluster for that time increment and is broken down to show the cost of each application in the cluster.
- You can include or exclude applications from the display by clicking on the application names in the key above the bars.
- To see a subtotal for a particular application, click on its color in a bar.

## Top Spend Summary

Below the bar chart, a table summarizes your top spend applications in the cluster. The applications appear in order from highest to lowest cost proportion in your Wave cluster.

The table includes the following information for each application:
- Application
- % of Total Costs
- Compute Cost
- Storage Cost
- Driver Count
- Executor Count
- Total Cost

The total cost for all the applications in the cluster appears at the bottom of the table.

## Application Drill Down

In the Top Spend Summary, you can see a breakdown of costs per driver for each application. Just click on the application name.

The breakdown per application shows the following details:
- Driver
- % of App Costs
- Namespace
- Total Executors
- Compute Cost
- Storage Cost
- Executor Count
- Total Cost
