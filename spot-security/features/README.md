### Risk Analysis

Spot Security’s [Risk Analysis](spot-security/features/analyze-risks/) shows you the security risks discovered in your cloud environment with visibility at a high level and at a very detailed-level view. Spot Security then takes the next step of showing you the appropriate remediations that you can act on.  

### Topology View

### Visibility by Events

The [Events](spot-security/features/events) page provides insights into your cloud environment by showing a historical listing of all events occurring. Statistics are provided to help you see the big picture, and details about each event are available.

### Resource Inventory

The [Inventory](spot-security/features/inventory) provides a listing of all assets detected within your cloud network (per scan at a specific time), enabling you to see your cloud environment from another important perspective.
