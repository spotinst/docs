For your reference, Spot Security provides information on how compliant each asset is with global security standards. You can assess your coverage of globalsecurity standards on Spot.

To view your compliance with global security standards, go to Spot Security in the left menu of the console and click Compliance.

## Security Compliance

You can select different ways to view the compliance of your assets under two tabs:
* Total Compliance: Provides information of how each globalSecurity Standard that you chose complies with your assets.
* CIS Benchmark: Provides compliance information regarding a major standards organization.

## Favorite Standards Chart

This line graph shows the compliance of the assets in your cloud system with the selected global security standards at the bottom of the page. You can choose the time frames of two weeks, one month, or three months. You can also choose to see the compliance of assets on a specific date next to Snapback.

You can export the data of the compliance to an Excel sheet.

Hovering over a specific line that represents a global security standard shows the percentage of the compliance of the global security standard.
