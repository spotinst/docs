# Events

Spot Security strives to reduce the Signal-to-Noise ratio of cloud security events for the users and highlight the events that have occurred on your cloud network within a defined time period based on event security.

To view the Events, go to Spot Security in the left menu of the console and click Events.

## Event Overview
You can choose to see the events of a particular cloud account, asset type, or region or view all events altogether. In addition, you can choose a time range to view specific events.

You can select a time range to view among two hours, six hours, one day or a custom date and time in the top right corner. The selected time changes the data for the events overview as well as the events trendline.

Spot Security classifies the events into the following categories:

* Configuration Change
* IAM Change
* Critical Event
* Data Access
* Anomalies
* Audit and Compliance Impact- events and risks
