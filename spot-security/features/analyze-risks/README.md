# Risk Analysis

The risk analysis feature provides visibility into your risks on several levels of granularity including a top-level aggregation per risk level, a listing of all risks, and a drill-down level of [Risk Details](spot-security/features/analyze-risks/view-risk-details) per each risk.

To analyze your risks, go to Spot Security in the left tree of the console and click Risk Analysis.

## Filters and Presets

The default filter or preset on this page is the same filter or preset that you chose on the Dashboard. You can change the filters or choose a different preset from the list of presets.

## Risk Totals per Level

This top-level view shows the total number of risks per risk-level. Each level also shows the number of new risks identified since the last scan.
