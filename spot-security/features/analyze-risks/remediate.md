## Ways to Remediate

The Remediation page shows the name of the risk at the top, the risk details in a sidebar on the right, and the remediation actions in the middle of the page. The tabs indicate the different ways to implement the remediation, which are described below.

### Using AWS CLI

The default method displayed provides the steps for using AWS CLI. You can copy and paste the commands illustrated in the steps, and you can also edit the commands directly in the console before copying them for use in the CLI.

Spot Security provides guided remediation of assets. You only need to replace the placeholder values to the actual asset details that they remediate.
