# Create a Preset

A preset is a set of filter settings that you have saved and can access for later use in the [Security Dashboard](spot-security/features/security-dashboard/). Presets are great when you need to see security summaries for specific accounts, services, and regions.

## Create a Preset

Go to the Spot Security dashboard.

3. Enter a name for the preset, mark if you want to save this preset as the default, and click Save. For your first preset, you do not need to mark the default box.

Once you have created a new preset, the name will appear as part of the Security Summary title.

## Use a Saved Preset

To apply a saved preset, click on the down arrow next to the Security Summary title.

If the list is long, type the first few letters of the preset name in the search box and click search.

## Edit or Delete a Preset

The edit function enables you to change the preset name or to change the default. To make one of these changes, go to the preset in the dropdown list and click the pencil icon in the same row. Make your changes and save.
