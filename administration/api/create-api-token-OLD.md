> **Tip**: To create a programmatic token, you must first [create a programmatic user](administration/users/programmatic-users).

3. Give your token a name and click Generate. Your access token will appear in the window and will not appear again once closed.

!> Remember to keep your tokens secret. Treat them just like passwords. They act on your behalf when interacting with the API. Do not share your personal access tokens with anyone outside your organization. Do not hard-code them into your programs. Instead, use environment variables. Please contact our support if you're concerned your token has been compromised.
