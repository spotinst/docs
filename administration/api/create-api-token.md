2. The Spot console provides both permanent and temporary tokens. For permanent tokens, select the corresponding user type, either 'Personal' or 'Programmatic'. Temporary tokens are created via the Spot API and the options for doing so are presented on screen.

3. Give your token a name and click Generate. Your access token will appear in the window.

!> Remember to keep your tokens secret. Treat them just like passwords. They act on your behalf when interacting with the API. Do not share your personal access tokens with anyone outside your organization. Do not hard-code them into your programs. Instead, use environment variables. Please contact our support if you're concerned your token has been compromised.
