# Read Notifications

You can access and read all of your notifications on a single page. The Notifications page shows your Spot messages and event notifications. In addition, you can see a list of news items about Spot from the [spot.io blog](https://spot.io/news/).

## Notification List

The main notification list appears in the middle of the page and includes all of the messages you have received.

The shaded notifications at the top are sent from Spot by NetApp and may include announcements about new features or information about Spot products and services. Spot notifications are sticky, meaning that they are pinned to the top of the list for a certain time period. When that time period for a notification is up, it appears unshaded with all the other notifications.

The unshaded notifications are about events in your system (except for the Spot messages that have been unshaded). The notifications appear according to what you have configured in the Event Policies page. Icons on the event notifications indicate the severity of the issue and which product the notification relates to.

The notifications show one line of text. Click the message to see the full body of the message.

## Filters

There are several options for filtering notifications.
- Enter text or key words in the Filter field to filter by topic, type, or content of the messages.
- Enter a date range to narrow the filter to specific dates.
- Click the flag icon to filter by notifications that have been flagged.
- Click the envelope icon to filter by notifications that have not been read yet.

## What’s New

The What’s New column on the right lists the last six articles on the spot.io blog. When you click one of these, the corresponding blog page on spot.io opens. When you click View All, you are directed to the main blog page where you have access to all the blog topics.
