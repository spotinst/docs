1. Mark Personal Visibility if you want the policy to be visible only to you. You will not be able to add integrations. If you leave the checkbox blank, the policy will be available to other members of the account it is in, and you will be able to add integrations.

2. Click Continue.

## Step 1: Select Resources

Select resource types for the policy and click Next. You can select three types of notifications you want to receive: notifications for [clusters](ocean-cd/tutorials/view-settings/?id=clusters), [rollouts](ocean-cd/tutorials/view-rollouts/) or [entities](ocean-cd/getting-started/rollout-entities/).

If you want to add integrations to your policy to get notifications of the clusters, rollouts or entities, click Next (Optional).  

If you do not want to add notifications and complete the policy creation process, click Create Policy Now.    

## Step 3: Add Integrations (Optional)

The integrations determine how the notifications will be delivered.

You can receive notifications by external email. Turn the External Email toggle on and add email addresses that will receive notifications.

You can now edit the policy and determine which Spot users will receive notifications.
