2. Mark Personal Visibility if you want the policy to be visible only to you. You will not be able to add integrations. If you leave the checkbox blank, the policy will be available to other members of the account it is in, and you will be able to add integrations.
3. Click Continue.

To complete the policy definition, you will need to complete all parts of the wizard to select an account, rules, regions, and integrations. Once the policy is created, you may need to edit it to select users who will have access.  

## Step 1: Select Account

Select the account the notification policy should apply to.

Once you have chosen your regions, you can click Create to create the policy.

## Step 4: Select Integrations (Optional)

If you (an Admin user) are configuring a policy at the Account level, you can select one or more integrations. The integrations determine how the notifications will be delivered.

The following integrations are available:

* External Email: Add email addresses that will receive notifications.

The following attributes will be sent as part of the CSV attached in the external email:  

* Security Rule	 
* Asset Name	 
* Asset ID	 
* Asset Type
* Cloud
* Cloud Account ID
* Region

## Select Users

Once you (an Admin user) have created an Account level policy, only you are registered to the policy. You can now edit the policy and determine which Spot users will receive notifications.
