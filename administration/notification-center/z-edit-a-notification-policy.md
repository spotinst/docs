2. In the left menu, click Notification Center, then click on Event Policies.
3. In the dashboard, click the name of the policy you need to edit. The Policy Details page for that policy will appear.

## Policy Details

The Policy Details page provides both an overview and detailed information about a given policy. You can view important details about the policy, modify the policy, and take various actions on the policy.

At the top of the page, a status icon next to the policy name indicates whether the policy is active or not. The page includes the following main areas, which are all editable:

- Overview
- Resources
- Events
- Integrations
- Registered Users

These are described in detail below.

2. Edit the owner, the policy name, and the description, as needed, and click Update. (Only an Admin user can change the owner.)

The Visibility of a policy cannot be changed.

## Edit Resources

To modify the rules for monitoring resources, do the following:

1. Click the Edit icon above the Resources list.

### All Resources

If the policy is set to monitor all resources, then there is no need to modify the list of resources. However, you can change the monitoring method to rule-based or manual.

### Rule-Based Resources

For rule-based resources, you can modify, add, and delete conditions and condition sets.
