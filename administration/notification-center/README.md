# Notification Center

With the Notification Center, the Spot console provides a robust and flexible tool for configuring and managing notifications. The notification center uses a system of user definable policies, providing granular management of notifications and customization to fit different business cases. This includes the ability to customize notification policies per:

- Resources monitored
- Events to be notified
- Notification media such as Slack, email, and SNS
- Users and stakeholders to be notified

## Get Started

To access the Notification Center, do the following:

1. In the upper right, click on the User icon, and then click My Account in the menu.

## Notification Center Dashboard
