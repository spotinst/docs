# Notification Center

The Notification Center provides a robust tool for defining the types of notifications you receive. This includes a tool for creating and editing notification policies, and a tool for reading system notifications about events in your clusters, news messages from Spot by NetApp, and previews of the latest blog pages on spot.io.
