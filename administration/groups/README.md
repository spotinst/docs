# Groups

In Spot, a *group* is a set of one or more [users](administration/users-a/) that have the same [policies](administration/policies/). You use groups in order to assign or modify policies for several users at once. You can use different types of groupings for managing users, for example:

- By Spot service: Eco users, Elastigroup users, Ocean Users
- By access role: Admins, Account editors, Account viewers, Credit card editors
- By organizational department or function: Developers, Finance Dept., Sales Dept.

You can associate a user with multiple groups.

## How it works

We make it really easy for you to create a new group with the creation wizard. The wizard includes the simple steps summarized below. For the detailed procedures, see [Create New Group](administration/groups/create-new-group).
1. Define the most basic group details such as the group name and a brief description of the group purpose.
2. Add users to the group.
3. Attach policies to the group. This will determine which permissions the users in that group will have.

Once you have created a group, you can edit the group information, add and remove users, and change the policies at any time. You can also remove a group.
