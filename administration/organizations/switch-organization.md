# Switch Organization

If your user is mapped to more than one organization, you can easily switch from one organization to another.

1. In the console, click the Organization.

<img src="/administration/_media/switch-organization-01a.png" />

2. Choose the the name of the organization from the dropdown list. If you do not see the name in the list, enter the first few characters of the organization until the name appears in the list, and then click the name.

<img src="/administration/_media/switch-organization-02.png" width="370" height="128" />

Spot will then switch to the organization you chose.

  You can learn more about expected usage of this approach in the [GitLab UI docs](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-collapse--default) though the solution we use above is specific to usage in markdown.
