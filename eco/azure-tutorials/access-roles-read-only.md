# Access Roles and Permissions - Read-Only

As mentioned on the [Azure EA Tutorial](eco/azure-tutorials/) there is a three step process to get setup with Eco Azure. The information on this page is relevant to Analysis step (Step 1).

## Azure role needed for Eco Azure Analysis and Planning

The role and EA Read Only Admin access below is relevant only for customers who have not yet signed a contract for Eco Azure.

### Reservation Reader role

The Eco team requests customers to assign the [Azure Reservation Reader](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/view-reservations#assign-a-reservation-reader-role-at-the-tenant-level) role to the user group of guest users in order to accurately perform the initial analysis.
