# Azure EA Tutorials

Eco actively manages the full lifecycle of your commitments, including planning, purchasing, exchanging and canceling. It ensures that your reserved instance portfolio is optimized from the start, beginning with your existing commitment purchases and creating a well-balanced mix of reserved instances that continues to adapt to changing needs and usage.

## How it Works

Eco takes you through the three-step process described below.

### Analyze

Eco combines years of analysis of detailed marketplace and industry usage data with the complete details of your cloud purchases and usage by region, instance family, lifespan, and scale. This analysis is used to provide a holistic view of on-demand use across all of your Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) subscriptions.

### Plan

Eco uses those analytics to determine optimal purchasing strategies tailored to your cloud usage, evaluating your existing reserved instance portfolio together with any number of commitment purchase options to keep commitment terms low and utilization high. You save the highest amount possible while retaining the most flexibility for the future.

### Act

Based on those analytics and strategies, Eco helps you to build and manage your portfolio of committed capacity purchases. Constantly tweaking strategies based on market availability and new data, Eco continuously buys, exchanges, cancels, and manages your portfolio to maximize savings with an optimal mix of reserved instances.
