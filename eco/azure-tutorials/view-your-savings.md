## Filters

The default view of the Eco Azure dashboard shows data from all the subscriptions in your Azure Tenant.

During the first setup of the Eco Azure dashboard, data from the past 90 days is loaded and then updated daily going forward.

By default, the dashboard shows all loaded data from Azure that Eco Azure has available. However, you can use the drop-down filters to limit the scope of data displayed.

You can set the following filters:

- Time: Choose the range of dates for which data will be displayed for the chart and tables.
- Regions: Choose the regions which will be included in the chart and tables.

## Summary Line

The Overview dashboard includes a summary line which displays the following information:

- Current Monthly Commitment: The dollar amount of monthly commitment for reserved instance coverage
- Current Monthly Waste: The dollar amount of monthly waste for reserved instance coverage

## Graphs and Charts

Eco Azure provides summary graphs and charts to give you wide visibility of your savings and commitments. The graphs and charts can be filtered according to the items in the legend. The following graphs are displayed:

### Savings over Time
