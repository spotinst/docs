# View Savings in Dashboard

Once Eco has been enabled for your organization and you have chosen your reserved instance (RI) [Strategy](eco/tutorials/choose-a-strategy), your Eco dashboard will switch to a more complete view of savings.

To view the Eco dashboard in the console, go to Eco on the left side and click Dashboard.

## Filters

The default view of the dashboard shows data from all the accounts in your organization.

By default, the dashboard shows data since the first day of your AWS account, from all regions, and from all of your AWS services. However, you can use the drop-down filters to limit the scope of data displayed. For example, you can display according to services such as EC2, RDS, and ElastiCache.

You can set the following filters:

- Selected Services: Choose the services which will be included in the charts and tables.
- Time: Choose the range of dates for which data will be displayed.

## Summary Line

The Overview dashboard includes a summary line which displays the following information:

- Total Saved: Total amount saved as a result of reserved instance utilization.
- Current Commitment:The amount currently committed to reserved instances. The lower the commitment, the more flexible and dynamic the account's compute resources can be.
- Additional Potential Savings: The amount of additional potential savings in USD on top of existing RIs.
- Current EC2 Commitment: The current percentage of On-Demand instances in the account that are covered by reservations.
- Max EC2 Commitment: Maximum potential committed amount.

## Graphs and Charts

Eco provides summary graphs and charts to give you wide visibility of your savings and commitments. The graphs and charts can be filtered according to the items in the legend. The following graphs are displayed:

- Savings over time: A bar graph showing the amount of savings each month broken down by type of savings. This graph will allow you to visualize savings from reservations and savings plans. You can use the filters at the top of the page and source filters specific to each graph.
  - All
  - Eco
  - Non-Eco

- Commitment over Time: A bar graph showing your reserved instance commitment per month broken down into Standard, Convertible, and Pending instances.
- Coverage Over Time: A line graph that breaks down the story of how reservations, savings plan coverage, and commitments relate to your overall savings. The left chart is the simplest, showing the difference between your actual spend and what could have been your costs for reservable services without a savings strategy (on-demand dollar equivalent). On the right, you see the same data, but with your actual spend explained as the combination of commitment cost and uncovered spend.

- Commitment per Service: A pie chart showing the current reserved instance commitment broken down into the different services.
- Commitment per Region: A pie chart showing the current reserved instance commitment broken down by region.

## Reservation Details Report

Below the overview graphs and pie charts, you can see a table with detailed information about your reserved instances, including your total generated savings at the bottom of the table.
