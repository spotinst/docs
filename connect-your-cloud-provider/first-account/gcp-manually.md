# Connect GCP Manually

This page describes the procedures for manually (i.e., using the GCP console) connecting your GCP account to Spot. The procedure assumes that you are following the instructions in the [onboarding wizard](connect-your-cloud-provider/first-account/), have already created your Spot organization, and selected GCP as your cloud provider. You are connecting a linked account, and are now at Step 3.1 as shown below.

## Step 3.1: Click Manually

## Step 3.3: Create a new Service Account

In this step you create a service account that Spot will use to manage resources in your GCP account and assign it the role of Editor. Complete this step in the order of the bullets in the wizard.
