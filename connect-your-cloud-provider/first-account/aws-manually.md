# Connect AWS Manually

This page describes the procedures for manually (i.e., using the AWS console) connecting your AWS account to Spot. The procedure assumes that you are following the instructions in the [onboarding wizard](connect-your-cloud-provider/first-account/), have already created your Spot organization, and selected AWS as your cloud provider. You are connecting a linked account, and are now at Step 3.2 as shown below.

> **Tip**: If this is not the first account you are connecting to Spot, and you are now connecting an additional account, the step below is numbered 3.1.

## Step 3.2: Click Manually
