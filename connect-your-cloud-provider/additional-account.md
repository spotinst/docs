# Connect an Additional Account

Once you have completed your Spot registration and connected your first account (either a linked or a managed account), you can connect additional accounts to your Organization in Spot. Your additional accounts can be from the same cloud provider or from different ones (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

## Get Started

Go to Insights & Recommendations in the Dashboard. When you open the Spot console or when you have connected a cloud provider for the first time, this is the default view.

## Step 3: Connect your Cloud Account

Complete the steps for connecting your cloud account. If you chose AWS or GCP, you will need to choose whether to connect automatically or manually, as you did when you connected your first account. For Azure, you do not need to choose.

Once you have completed all the instructions in the wizard, a banner will appear indicating a successful connection and the Dashboard page is displayed.
