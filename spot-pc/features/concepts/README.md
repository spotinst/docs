# Spot PC concepts
This section covers concepts and policies that are specific to Spot PC to help define terms used in the documentation and the Spot PC console.

## Spot PC Hierarchy
Spot PC is organized in a way to maximize the flexibility fo the access and control of Spot PC resources.  Multiple layers of organization exist to achieving this goal. This diagram illustrates each layer from organization to users:

### Spot Group
The Spot Group represents a collection of users with homogeneous application requirements.

Spot Groups are populated by one or more existing security groups from the customer Active Directory configuration.  Users are added/removed from the Spot Group by being added or removed to the linked AD security group(s).

A single VM image is assigned to the Spot Group.  Thus, all host VMs are identical and all user sessions on those machines will have access to the same applications.

A user can be a member of multiple Spot Groups and will receive access to the appropriate resources.  Note that users with multiple Spot Groups assigned may consume additional Spot PC licensing.

One or more session host VM is built for each Spot Group. The machines are dedicated to the Spot Group and not shared with other Spot Groups. These machines are used to host the user sessions.  The size and quantity of available hosts are determined by Spot PC licensing and the performance optimization technology included in Spot PC.  

### Tenant
The Tenant represents a customer that uses the Spot PC service.

A Spot PC tenant must be associated with one (and only one) Azure tenant.

Tenants can contain one or more Spot Group(s).

### Organization
The Organization represents an IT support organization.  Typically this is a Managed Services Provider (MSP) supporting multiple customers or an internal IT department supporting one or more business units.

All tenants are assigned to one (and only one) Organization. Multiple Tenants can be assigned to the same Organization.



## Session Hosts

## Spot PC Admins

## Images
VM Images are an area of emphasis and focus for Spot PC management.  The goal is that all customization to session host VM be done at the image level, allowing Spot PC optimization automation to manage the creation, deletion and availability of session hosts automatically.
 
This this end the Spot PC Console includes an Images workflow for creating, customizing and sealing VM images.  This workflow integrates with Azure Images and Azure Image Gallery and makes the task of managing images far simpler.

Within the Spot PC Console there is an Image Set Library, accessible from the Config Actions menu, within any tenant. From this menu the Spot PC administrator can:
* List (view) the image set library
* Create a new image set
* Edit an existing image set
* Delete an existing image set
