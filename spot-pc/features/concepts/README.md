## Images
VM Images are an area of emphasis and focus for Spot PC management.  The goal is that all customization to session host VM be done at the image level, allowing Spot PC optimization automation to manage the creation, deletion and availability of session hosts automatically.

This this end the Spot PC Console includes an Images workflow for creating, customizing and sealing VM images.  This workflow integrates with Azure Images and Azure Image Gallery and makes the task of managing images far simpler.

Within the Spot PC Console there is an Image Set Library, accessible from the Config Actions menu, within any tenant. From this menu the Spot PC administrator can:
* List (view) the image set library
* Create a new image set
* Edit an existing image set
* Delete an existing image set
