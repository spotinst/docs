# Tenant: Machines
From any other tenant-specific page, clicking on the _Machines_ tab brings you to this page.

1. Like other tenant pages, [Config Actions](spot-pc/features/spot-pc-console/tenant/config-actions) can be accessed, a summary of active users/machines/security alerts is shown and other tenant pages can be accessed by clicking the appropriate tab across the top.
2. Machines are listed along with live performance data.
3. Clicking on a machine name will bring you to a context specific to that machine. Performance graphs, active processes and other details are shown.
4. Clicking on a machine source will bring you the Spot Group (or Provisioning Policy for Win365 deployments) to which this machine is associated.
