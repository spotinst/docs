# Tenant: Security

From any other tenant-specific page, clicking on the _Security_ tab brings you to this page. This page displays security data from the Microsoft Defender for Cloud service that is included in the Spot PC service. Spot PC admins can and should leverage this data to secure their Spot PC environments in a way that supports their tenants' workflow and security requirements.

1. Like other tenant pages, [Security](spot-pc/features/spot-pc-console/tenant/security) can be accessed by clicking the appropriate tab across the top.
2. Security alerts are displayed as a circle chart based on risk level.
3. An over-all security score and the Microsoft Defender score are displayed, acting on the recommendations from Microsoft Defender for Cloud can improve these scores.
4. Security alerts are listed at the bottom. Clicking the description will bring you to details about the alert and provide for action to be taken.
5. Recommendations are listed at the bottom, accessed by clicking the Recommendations tab. Recommendations can be expanded to see detail. Acting on these recommendations can negatively impact end user workflows and should be handled through your own change control process to avoid impacting end user productivity.
