# End User Connection Requirements

The following Remote Desktop clients support Azure Virtual Desktop:

* Windows Desktop
* Web
* macOS
* iOS
* IGEL Thin Client (Linux)
* Android (Preview)

**NOTE:** Azure Virtual Desktop does not support the RemoteApp and Desktop Connections (RADC) client or the Remote Desktop Connection (MSTSC) client.

**IMPORTANT:** Azure Virtual Desktop does not currently support the Remote Desktop client from the Windows Store. Support for this client will be added in a future release.

The Remote Desktop clients must have access to the following URLs:
