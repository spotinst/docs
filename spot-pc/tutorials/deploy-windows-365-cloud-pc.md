# Deploy Windows 365 Cloud PC Workflow
Deploying Windows 365 Cloud PC desktops with Spot PC takes three simple configuration workflows: [Connections](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc?id=create-connection), [Images](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc?id=create-image) and [Provisioning Policies](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc?id=create-provisioning-policy).

NOTE: This is the Windows 365 Cloud PC workflow, for Spot PC, [click here](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-spot-pc).

## Create Connection
To begin this workflow navigate to _Config Actions > Create Connection_ from within the appropriate tenant.

Creating the Connection is the first step towards adding a new (or additional) Windows 365 Cloud PC group. This Connection is analogous to the Spot Group for a Spot PC deployment.

### Select
Select the site for the VM Image to be built (and to reside in) once completed. You can select from all available sites in the tenant.

### Choose Credentials
Enter a Domain Join admin account and password to facilitate the deployment of these Cloud PC desktops. A unique admin account (dedicated to Domain Join actions in Spot PC) for solely this purpose is recommended for security reasons.

### Connection Detail
Enter a name for this Connection.

### Review and Save Configuration
Review your selections, navigate to _previous_ steps to make changes.

### Health Check

## Create Image

To begin this workflow navigate to _Config Actions > Create Device Image_ from within the appropriate tenant.

Creating a VM image is the second step towards adding a new (or additional) Windows 365 Cloud PC group.  The image will then be assigned to the Windows 365 Connection created in the [next step](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc) of this process.

### Enter Image Name
Enter a name for this image.

### Select Site

### Version

### Select Source Image

Creating a Provisioning Policy is the third step towards adding a new (or additional) Windows 365 Cloud PC group.  The Provisioning Policy associates the Connection with the Image and associates users to complete the Windows 365 Cloud PC creation process.
