# Deploy Windows 365 Cloud PC Workflow
Deploying Windows 365 Cloud PC desktops with Spot PC takes three simple configuration workflows:  Connections, Images and Provisioning Policies.

# Create Connection

# Create Image
NOTE: This is the Spot PC workflow, for Windows 365 Cloud PC, [click here](spot-pc/tutorials/create-image?id=create-image-for-spot-pc-workflow).

To begin this workflow navigate to _Config Actions > Create Device Image_ from within the appropriate tenant.

Creating a VM image is the first step towards adding a new (or additional) group of users and resources to an organization.  The image will then be assigned to the Windows 365 Connection created in the [next step](spot-pc/tutorials/deploy-windows-365-cloud-pc) of this process.
