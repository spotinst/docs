# Spot PC Tutorial: Manage Users and Groups

Spot PC is built to manage access to resources (desktops) based on the AD security groups of the tenant's company.

When creating or editing a Spot Group, the admin can specify the groups(s) associated with that Spot Group and all members of those groups will be automatically granted access to Spot PC resources.

AD Security group membership is not managed from within the Spot PC console to minimize security exposure of the customer's AD environment.
