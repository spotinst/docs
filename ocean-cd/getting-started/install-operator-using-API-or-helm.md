# Install Operator using API or Helm

If you are not using the Spot console to install the operator, you can install using the Spot API or using Helm.

Whichever method you choose, you will need to indicate whether your cluster has an Argo Rollout installation. If you do not have an Argo Rollout installation, Ocean CD dynamically generates Argo rollout manifests on your behalf. In addition, Ocean CD supports use of your own flags and personal Argo customization.

> Tip: If you do not want Ocean CD to generate Argo manifests (e.g., you have already configured your own customized ones), you may configure otherwise.

For further information, have a look at additional [resources supported](https://github.com/spotinst/spot-oceancd-releases/tree/main/Quick%20Start%20%26%20Examples) such as affinity, tolerations, podSecurityContext, and nodeSelector.

## Prerequisite
- Kubernetes cluster up and running (on AWS, Azure or GCP)
- Workstation with the Kubernetes cluster context and kubectl installed
- Install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
- API Token

The purpose of OLM is to extend Kubernetes to provide a declarative way to install, manage, and upgrade operators on a cluster. OLM is required for all installation methods.

To install OLM, use the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.21.2/install.sh | bash -s v0.21.2
```

Be sure to use the [latest OLM version](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases) in order to include the latest updates and fixes.

## Install using API

In your Kubernetes cluster, run the following API command, which will result in the download of a YAML file. Be sure to add the flags required for Argo installation.

```
https://api.spotinst.io/ocean/cd/clusterInstaller?clusterId=CLUSTER_ID&skipArgoRollouts=true
```

Should you wish to apply the command using Curl, use the syntax below. Be sure to replace the Authorization with your Bearer Token and the ClusterID with the Identifier of your choice.

```curl
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.spotinst.io/ocean/cd/clusterInstaller?clusterId=CLUSTER_ID&skipArgoRollouts=true' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx' \
--data-raw ''
```

## Install using Helm

Complete the steps below.

1. Add the OceanCD Helm chart repository:

```
helm repo add oceancd https://charts.oceancd.io
```

2. Update your local Helm chart repository cache:

```
helm repo update
```

3. Install spot-oceancd-operator:

```
helm install my-release oceancd/spot-oceancd-operator \
  --set token=REDACTED \
  --set clusterId=REDACTED \
  # [...]
```

Configure all required chart values using the `set` command line argument or a `values.yaml` file.

### Uninstall Ocean CD Operator

If you need to uninstall spot-oceancd-operator, use the procedure below.

```
helm uninstall my-release

kubectl get csv -A | grep spot-oceancd-operator | awk '{system("kubectl delete csv " $2 " -n " $1)}'

kubectl delete apiservices v1.packages.operators.coreos.com

kubectl delete -f https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.20.0/crds.yaml

kubectl delete -f https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.20.0/olm.yaml
```
