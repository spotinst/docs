# End-to-End Setup

This procedure describes how to install the operator, create services and Spot Deployments as well as your Ocean CD entities.  This procedure provides end-to-end insights of the OceanCD flow you will perform in order to successfully trigger your very first deployment.   

## Prerequisites

* Run Kubernetes cluster in Azure, Google, or Amazon
* OceanCDâ€™s [CLI](https://github.com/spotinst/spot-oceancd-cli#installation) tool is installed. If you do not have it installed already, you can run the following command to install it:

`brew install spotinst/tap/oceancd`

* If you are using permit lists or tools like OPA, please permit the following images:
  - docker.io/spotinst/spot-oceancd-operator:$VERSION
  - docker.io/spotinst/spot-oceancd-operator-catalog:latest
  - docker.io/spotinst/spot-oceancd-operator-bundle:$VERSION
  - quay.io/operator-framework/olm
  - quay.io/operatorhubio/catalog:latest

## Step 1: Install the Operator

Install the operator in order to provide access to your cluster workload to Ocean CD.  

_For demo purposes, the YAML method will be provided via the console._

1. Under Ocean CD in the Spot console, click Settings, and then click Add Cluster.

2. Complete the information:
* Cluster Identifier: This is a logical identifier for your cluster. You can choose any ID, and it is not coupled to the Ocean cluster ID (o-xxxxxx). Ocean CD can run on clusters that are not managed by Ocean. The cluster ID must be unique, have up to 30 alphanumeric characters, and not contain spaces.
* Argo Rollout Installation: Ocean CD uses Argo rollouts as part of its engine. If Argo Rollout is not installed, Ocean CD will install it (based on the selected option).

3. Download the YAML and apply it to your Kubernetes cluster.
`kubectl apply -f <Name of the YAML>`

**If this is not specified in the command, the operator will be installed in the Ocean CD namespace.**

When the process is complete and the operator pods are running, your cluster will automatically appear in the Cluster Settings section.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/getting-started-n04.png" />

> **Tip**: Once you have downloaded the YAML, the new row will remain with partial information for five minutes. If five minutes elapsed and the YAML was not applied, the row and the banner will be removed. However, the YAML can still be applied at another time, and the Ocean CD will display the new data accordingly.

Once the OceanCD operator is installed you can create your Kubernetes entities: Services & SpotDeployment.   

## Step 2: Create a Namespace and Services

Create a namespace in order to make sure all of the following Kubernetes entities you will create will be found in the same namespace.

1. Run the following command:

`kubectl create ns oceancd-workshop`

When a namespace is created, you will create the canary and stable services to expose and manage the traffic split between the canary and the stable replicasets.   

_For demo purposes, there will be no use of a traffic manager._

2. Copy and run the following YAML file on your computer:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo-stable
  namespace: oceancd-workshop
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080`
```
---

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: rollouts-demo-canary
  namespace: oceancd-workshop
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

3. Copy and run the following command in your cluster :

      `kubectl apply -f <Service YAML>`   

## Step 3: Create a SpotDeployment

To trigger the OceanCD engine, you will be required to use our CRD called SpotDeployment.

1. Copy and run the following YAML file on your computer:

```yaml
apiVersion: `spot.io/v1beta1`
kind: SpotDeployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: oceancd-workshop
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: public.ecr.aws/nginx/nginx:1.22
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

**The difference between a deployment and a SpotDeployment is the API version and kind.**

2. Copy and run the following command in your cluster:  

`kubectl apply -f <SpotDeployment YAML>`  

Now that your SpotDeployment and services were created, the remaining step is to create the OceanCD entities. These will act as the rules for your canary deployment to follow.

## Step 4: Create Verification

This step focuses on the creation of the verification provider and verification template. These entities allow you to insert any data analysis you require during the running of your deployments from any of our supported monitoring tools.

### Install Prometheus

The procedure below describes how to set Prometheus in your cluster. Prometheus is a monitoring tool that collects and stores measurements as time-series data. If it is already installed, you can skip to the creation of the verification provider entity itself.

_For demo purposes, the Prometheus monitoring tool will be used._

1. Run the following command to deploy Prometheus:

```
kubectl create namespace prometheus
```

```
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
```

```
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus \
    --namespace prometheus \
    --set alertmanager.persistentVolume.storageClass="gp2" \
    --set server.persistentVolume.storageClass="gp2"
```

2. Make note of the Prometheus endpoint in helm response (this will be needed later) as follows:

The Prometheus server can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:

Prometheus- server.prometheus.svc.cluster.local

3. This DNS name for the verification provider template will soon be updated. Validate that the Prometheus components are deployed as expected by running the following command:

`kubectl get all -n prometheus`

4. The following response appears. All of the pods should be ready and available.

5. When Prometheus is installed, you can create the verification provider. Set your credentials by copying and running the following YAML file on your computer:


```yaml
kind: "VerificationProvider"
name: "prometheus-vp"
clusterIds:
  - "cluster-name"
prometheus:
  address: "http://prometheus-server.prometheus.svc.cluster.local:80"
```

**Note**:

* If you did not follow the tutorial, the naming convention of the address should be:  
`<svc name>.<ns name>.svc.cluster.local:portnumber`

* Insert the clusterID you chose during the operator installation.

* Make sure the Prometheus address is correct. If you have followed the Prometheus installation, the address should be configured well.

6. Run the command via CLI in your terminal:

`oceancd apply -f <VP Yaml>`

The verification template entity allows you to build in the query you want to apply to your monitoring tool. In addition to the query, it is also a configuration of a set of rules that the verifications will follow to determine whether a metric failed or was successful.  

7. Copy and run the following YAML file on your computer:

```yaml
kind: verificationTemplate
name: oceancd-workshop-vt
metrics:
- name: My-first-metric
  interval: 5s
  count: 10
  failureCondition: result[0] >= 100
  failureLimit: 5
  provider:
    prometheus:
      query: sum(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="oceancd-workshop"})
```

8. Run the command via CLI in your terminal:

`oceancd apply -f <VT Yaml> `

## Step 5: Create a Strategy

With this entity, you can set the rules of your canary deployment. This entity also enables you to configure pre-defined pauses, as well as the traffic percentage and any verifications created above you might need.

1. Copy and run the following YAML file on your computer:

apiVersion: `spot.io/v1beta1`

```yaml
kind: Strategy
name: "oceancd-workshop"
canary:  
  backgroundVerification:  
    templateNames:  
      - "oceancd-workshop-vt"
  steps:  
    - name: "My-first-phase"
      setWeight: 20
      verification:  
        templateNames:  
          - "oceancd-workshop-vt"
    - name: "second-phase"
      setWeight: 40
      verification:  
        templateNames:  
          - "oceancd-workshop-vt"
    - name: "third-phase"
      setWeight: 80
      verification:  
        templateNames:  
          - "oceancd-workshop-vt"
      pause:  
        duration: 1m
```

2. Run the command via CLI in your terminal:

`oceancd apply -f <Strategy Yaml>`

## Step 6: Create a RolloutSpec

This entity acts as the bridge between the OceanCD entities that were previously set up (verifications and strategy) and the Kubernetes entities created in the previous steps (services and SpotDeployment).

1. Copy and run the following YAML file on your computer:

apiVersion: `spot.io/v1beta1`

```yaml
kind: RolloutSpec
name: "OceanCD-Rolloutspec-1"
spotDeployment:  
 clusterId: "oceancd-demo"
 namespace: "oceancd-workshop"
 name: "nginx-deployment"
strategy:  
 name: "oceancd-workshop"
traffic:  
 canaryService: "rollouts-demo-canary"
 stableService: "rollouts-demo-stable"
failurePolicy:  
 action: abort
```

2. Run the command via CLI in your terminal:

`oceancd apply -f <RolloutSpec Yaml>`

##  Step 7: Trigger a Rollout

Now that everything is installed, you can trigger your very first rollout. Change the pod spec template such as the image in your SpotDeployment yaml and run the following command:

`kubectl apply -f <SpotDeployment YAML>`

A new Canary rollout will be automatically initiated in the All Rollouts table. Click the Rollout ID of your deployment to view the detailed rollout page and take action from the console.
