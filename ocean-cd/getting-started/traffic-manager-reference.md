# Traffic Manager Reference

In the [Migrate Workload](ocean-cd/getting-started/?id=migrate-a-workload-using-the-console) procedure, you can choose a traffic manager in the RolloutSpec configuration, and Ocean CD will configure it automatically.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/getting-started-n10.png" width="200" />

This page shows templates for all of the traffic managers that Ocean CD supports. If you would like to use a template instead of the automatic configuration, you can use one of these.

> **Tip**: You do not have to use a traffic manager. For more information, see [Without a Traffic Manager](ocean-cd/getting-started/traffic-manager-reference?id=without-traffic-manager).

### General Template for Syntax

```yaml
kind: RolloutSpec
name: RolloutSpec-OceanCD
spotDeployment:
 clusterId: cluster-name
 namespace: mynamespace
 name: nginx-deployment
strategy:
 name: Strategy-OceanCD
traffic:
 canaryService: rollouts-demo-stable
 stableService: rollouts-demo-canary
 nginx:
   stableIngress: rollouts-demo-ingress-nginx
   additionalIngressAnnotations:
     canary-by-header: X-Canary
     canary-by-header-value: iwantsit
failurePolicy:
 action: abort
```

Whenever `rootService` is used, the value must not be the same as the `stableService` value.

### ALB: Instance Level

```yaml
traffic:
  canaryService: rollouts-demo-canary
  stableService: rollouts-demo-stable
  alb:
    ingress: rollouts-demo-ingress
    servicePort: 80
    rootService: rollouts-demo-root
    stickinessConfig:
      enabled: true
      durationSeconds: 3600
    annotationPrefix: string
```

### ALB: IP Level

The IP Level is a new Argo feature. If you want to use this feature, be sure to have the latest Argo version.

```yaml
traffic:
  pingPong:
    pingService: rollouts-demo-canary
    pongService: rollouts-demo-stable
  alb:
    ingress: rollouts-demo-ingress
    servicePort: 80
    rootService: rollouts-demo-root
    stickinessConfig:
      enabled: true
      durationSeconds: 3600
    annotationPrefix: string    
```

### Ambassador

```yaml
traffic:
  canaryService: rollouts-demo-canary
  stableService: rollouts-demo-stable
  ambassador:
    mappings:
    - echo
```

### Istio: Host Level

```yaml
traffic:
  canaryService: rollouts-demo-canary
  stableService: rollouts-demo-stable
  istio:
    virtualServices:
      - name: rollout-vsvc
        routes:
          - primary
```

### Istio: Subset Level

```yaml
traffic:
  stableService: rollouts-demo-stable
  istio:
    virtualServices:
    - name: rollout-vsvc
      routes:
      - primary
    destinationRule:
      name: rollout-destrule
      canarySubsetName: canary
      stableSubsetName: stable
```

### NGINX

```yaml
traffic:
  canaryService: rollouts-demo-stable
  stableService: rollouts-demo-canary
  nginx:
    stableIngress: rollouts-demo-ingress-nginx
    additionalIngressAnnotations:
      canary-by-header: X-Canary
      canary-by-header-value: iwantsit   
```

### SMI

```yaml
traffic:
  canaryService: rollouts-demo-canary
  stableService: rollouts-demo-stable
  smi:
    rootService: rollouts-demo-root
```

### Without Traffic Manager

If a traffic manager is not explicitly configured, Ocean CD by default uses Kubernetes traffic methods based on replicas. You only need to add the service names for the Canary and Stable versions as shown in the template below..

```yaml
traffic:
 stableService: < >
 canaryService: < >
```
