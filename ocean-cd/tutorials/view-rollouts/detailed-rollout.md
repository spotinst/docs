# Detailed Rollout

The Detailed Rollout page provides the details of a specific rollout. To view a detailed rollout page, click the row of the rollout in the Rollouts list on the [View Rollouts](ocean-cd/tutorials/view-rollouts/) page.

The top line of the page shows the name of the rollout (Inventory App in the example below), the rollout type, an icon indicating the rollout status, and the time and duration of the rollout.

At the top of the page, you will also see banners providing information and guidance about the rollout process as various events occur.

The rollout details are presented in the following areas on the page.
- Summary Line
- Rollout Phases
- Application View
- Rollout Details

## Summary Line

Just above the summary line, you can see the cluster name, the namespace and the rollout ID.

The summary line includes the following information:
- Rollout type: Shows the current rollout type (e.g., Canary in the example above) as compared to Stable, which is the current version running.
- Image: Shows the current image and the image being rolled out.
- Kubernetes service: Enables network access for a set of pods.
- Traffic split: The percent of traffic exposed to the stable version and the Canary version being rolled out.
- Replicas: A graphical representation of the number of available replicas running the stable version and the number of replicas running the Canary version. The icons also show the status of each replica.

## Rollout Phases

This area shows the progress of the Canary version rollout and provides information about each phase of the rollout. The arrow at the top hides the Rollout phases area and expands the application view area.

### Failures

Should any of your phases encounter a failure or enter a pause, the display will be updated accordingly, enabling you to easily understand the status and the steps you would need to take.

Ocean CD will behave in accordance with the potential failure policy or paused statuses set prior to the rollout.

### Failure Types

Kubernetes failures may always be encountered. These failures could include: CrashLoop pod status, ImageLoop, Liveness Probe Failure, and others. For failures like these, OceanCD will automatically trigger a rollback action once the `progressDeadlineSeconds` are over,  regardless of the failure policy set. In addition, the rolled back workload will be considered as Degraded, unless configured otherwise.

*Degraded* means when a rollout is rolled back, it will scale up the Stable version (i.e., the version currently running) of the ReplicaSet, and scale down any other versions.

Although the stable version of the ReplicaSet may be running and is healthy, the overall rollout is still considered Degraded, since the desired version is not the version that is actually running.

To remove the Degraded status, you can do either of the following:
- Change the desired state back to the previous, stable version. This typically involves running `{{kubectl apply}}` against the previous Rollout spec.
- Re-run the `{{set image}}` command.

### Paused Status

Throughout a phase, Ocean CD will indicate when and for how long the phase will be in a paused status.

#### Pause without a pre-defined window

For such cases, the phase will be in a paused status, and its overall status will be visible in the list of rollouts in the Rollouts page and in all rollout cards (i.e., in the Summary Line).

When no pre-defined window has been configured in your strategy prior to the rollout, the pause will continue up until you decide otherwise.

You will be able to take the following actions at any time:
- Resume
- Roll Back.

#### Pause with a pre-defined window

For such cases, the phase will be in a paused status until the pre-defined window configured in the strategy entity is completed. After the window, the rollout will automatically move on to the next phase without any further action required.

### Actions

At any time, you can click the three dots at the top of the Rollout Phases panel and initiate one of the actions.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/tutorials-detailed-rollout-07.png" />

The following actions are available:
- Promote: Promote one phase to the next.
- Promote All: Promote a phase to the end of the rollout, triggering a success.
- Pause: Pause a full rollout. Once the rollout is resumed, it will continue from where it left off.
- Roll Back: The rollout will be terminated and the previous version (i.e., Stable) will be restored.
- Retry: Will be available to you only once a rollout was completed. With this action you will be able to retry your full rollout.

Whenever you click an action, you will be prompted to confirm before the action is actually taken.

### Rollout Cancelation

You can cancel a running rollout. Ocean CD supports a cancellation which provides you real-time status information including the newly created Rollout ID.

To cancel a rollout, just reapply the Spotdeployment running.

## Application View

The Application view provides information about the Kubernetes layer and the CRD diff. Each of the views also provides convenient tools to export the data and copy to the clipboard.

### Kubernetes events

The default view is by Kubernetes events as shown below.

### Kubernetes resources

This view shows the status breakdown per pod.

<img src="/ocean-cd/_media/tutorials-detailed-rollout-05.png" />

### CRD Diff

This view shows the difference between the CRD of the rollout and the CRD of the previous desired state.

## Rollout Details

If you would like to see the YAML files configured for a rollout, click Rollout Details on the upper right.

In the Rollout Details, you will be able to see the complete Strategy, and RolloutSpec YAMLs.
