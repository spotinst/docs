## View Workloads

You can view all the workloads in your cluster. Click Workloads in the left sidebar menu and the list of workloads will be displayed.

In addition, you can [migrate a deployment](ocean-cd/getting-started/?id=migrate-a-workload) to a Spotdeployment directly from the console. Once you have migrated the deployment, you will be able to see it on the Workloads page.

You can use the filter at the top to find a specific workload or filter for a set of workloads.

The list of live workloads provides the following information:
- Workload name: Name given to the workload (e.g., the application name).
- Workload type: Indicates whether the workload is a Deployment (i.e., not migrated to Ocean CD) or a Spotdeployment (already migrated).
- Cluster ID: The cluster where the workload is running.
- Namespace: Kubernetes object that partitions a single Kubernetes cluster into multiple virtual clusters. The namespace displayed in the Workloads table is the namespace (i.e., a virtual group of instances) to which the workload belongs.
- Image: Name and version number of the current version.
- Ready pods: Number of pods running this image.
