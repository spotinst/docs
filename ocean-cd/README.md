# Ocean CD

Ocean CD is a fully managed continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes applications.
Designed for end-to-end automation and verification of frequent application-deployment processes at scale.

Ocean CD fully automates your CD process, providing the key features of:
- Granular Visibility : Enabling visibility into the delivery process on multiple levels.
- Automated Deployment Engine: Automatically performing the rollout process. You configure your rollout preferences and OceanCD does the rest.
- Continuous Verification: Performing automatic deploy, run, and rollback processes based on SLOs.
- Automatic Rollbacks: Providing several types of rollbacks to enable a managed, smooth, and visible process that takes a microservice back to its last successful version.

Ocean CD makes Kubernetes an afterthought for application teams. Once you commit your code, Ocean CD takes care of operations, automation, and monitoring to ensure SLOs and production health.

Once you get started with Ocean CD, you will see the benefits stack up:
- End-to-end visibility and management​: Providing granular insight into the rollout process with real-time tracking of deployment phases​.
- High confidence in deployment reliability: Detection and mitigation of issues early to gracefully deploy code into production.
- One Spot for cloud operations and application delivery: Using Ocean CD along with Spot Ocean as your Kubernetes management and optimization tool. (Ocean CD can also be used independently of Ocean.)
