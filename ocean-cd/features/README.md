### External Verifications

[External verification](ocean-cd/features/external-verifications) is the method Ocean CD uses to integrate your unique test outcomes as part of an orchestrated release process.

Ocean CD performs automated [rollback](ocean-cd/features/rollback), a mission critical feature not covered out of the box by Kubernetes.

### Webhook Notifications

Ocean CD enables you to define [notification providers](ocean-cd/features/webhook-notifications) (end points) that will receive a webhook API notification with the detailed rollout process data.
