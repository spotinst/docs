# Webhook Notifications

Ocean CD enables you to define notification providers (endpoints) that will receive a webhook API notification with the detailed rollout process data.

## Notification Event Types

The following event types will trigger a webhook notification to the endpoints you define:
- controller-heartbeat-failure: The controller is not reporting a heartbeat for the configured amount of time.
- kubernetes-rolling-update-failed: The Kubernetes rolling update failed.
- kubernetes-rolling-update-finished: The Kubernetes rolling update finished.
- rollout-started: The Ocean CD rollout process began.
- rollout-failed: The Ocean CD rollout finished in failed status.
- rollout-failed-to-roll-back: Ocean CD failed to roll back the version.
- rollout-rolled-back: Ocean CD successfully rolled back the version.
- rollout-finished: The Ocean CD rollout successfully finished.
- start-external-verification: Ocean CD informs you start the external verification on your side.
