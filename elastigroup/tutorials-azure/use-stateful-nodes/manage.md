# Manage Stateful Nodes

Elastigroup enables you to see an overview of all your stateful nodes, get status at a glance, perform other tasks, and drill down to more detailed information when you need to.

To manage your stateful nodes in the Spot console, go to Elastigroup in the menu tree and click Stateful Nodes.
