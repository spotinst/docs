# Multiple Metrics

In its simplest form, autoscaling is based on tracking of a metric you choose, for example, Average CPU or Latency. When the metric exceeds a defined threshold, then a scaling action is triggered.

With Elastigroup, you can utilize more sophisticated autoscaling by creating and maintaining a list of many different metrics. This enables you to create complex criteria for scaling up or down by creating expressions that use data from several different metrics.

## How it Works

On a high level, Elastigroup uses scaling policies with multiple metrics according to the following process:
1. In the Scaling tab of the Elastigroup, you define several metrics in the Metric List.
2. You go to either [Simple Scaling Policies](elastigroup/features/scaling/simple-scaling-policies) or [Target Scaling Policies](elastigroup/features/scaling/target-scaling) and set up an autoscaling policy. In the policy, you define the Policy Type as Multiple Metric Scaling, and then define an expression that Elastigroup will use to evaluate a threshold.
3. Once the scaling policy is active, Elastigroup continually tracks the metrics and evaluates the expression you defined. When the expression surpasses your defined threshold, then a scaling action is triggered.

#### Examples

For example, you could create a scaling action based on the ratio of average CPU utilization to average memory utilization or an action based on the ratio of CPU utilization to 400 errors.

## Create a New Metric

To create a new metric, do the following:

1. In your Elastigroup, go to the Scaling tab and click Add New Metric.

### Metric Details

- Name: User-defined name of the metric. This name will be used in expressions you define in scaling policies.
- Autoscale based on: Choose one of the (AWS Cloudwatch) parameters in the list or choose Other. If you choose Other, complete the additional fields:
- Namespace: Choose from the list or choose Custom. If you choose Custom, you also need to enter a name for the Custom Namespace.
  - AWS Metric Name: The actual AWS metric, e.g., CPU Utilization.
  - Statistic: Type of value such as average, maximum or minimum.
- Unit: Choose the unit of measurement.
- Dimensions: (Optional) Choose from a list and set a value.

## View Metric List

Once you have created one or more metrics, you can view your full list of metrics. In your Elastigroup, just go to the Scaling tab and click Metric List.

## Edit a Metric

1. To edit a metric, click on the metric name in the Metric List.
2. Click Edit and update the fields.
3. Save your changes.

## Delete a Metric

1. To delete a metric, click on the metric name in the Metric List.
2. Click Remove Metric and confirm the removal.
